# RussellAssignments
These are projects I made for my friend Russell to learn programming
These are projects that you will go through, the way that this will work is that I will create a project description, you will then name a file and name it [projectName]\_solution.py, so an example would be, if the project for the day is named stack.py, your submission would be stack_solution.py, and you'll then submit it.
I'll periodically be updating this repository to have various kinds of projects that start off simple but increase in difficulty depending on your percieved skill level.
By the way, if you can't complete an assignment, that's totally fine, just message me about it and I can make a new one, but don't delete the difficult project, since you can always come back to it later. I'll probably be making a points system for this so you can have fun doing it too. <3
